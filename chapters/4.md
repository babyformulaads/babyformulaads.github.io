Richter profiles an excerpt from an Abbott/Ross training manual in her book. One section, entitled, “How to make a physician a low pressure sales person for our products,” suggests that once a mother chooses a brand of formula for her baby, she almost never switches brands. For formula companies, this can translate into easy customer retention once they can get their foot in the door.

>*“When one considers that for every one hundred infants discharged from hospital on a particular brand, approximately 93 percent remain on that brand, the importance of hospital selling becomes obvious,” the manual instructs salesmen.*

Mead Johnson employed 1,350 individuals worldwide as part of its healthcare professional sales force in 2011, according to a JP Morgan report. “Healthcare professional recommendations are a critical marketing level,” wrote senior analyst Terry Bivens, who authored the firm’s initiation report in 2009.

Graff found that a physician’s recommendation has more influence on moms than seeing company-sponsored advertisements. Although she considers herself especially informed as a researcher, as a mother, she said she felt just as vulnerable as any new mom. 

>*“When I look at these situations, I pull away everything that gives me an advantage,” Graff said. “And I think if I tore away all that and were in the same conversation, I would not even think to counter what pediatricians said. I would just do it.”*
