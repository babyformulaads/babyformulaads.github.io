<h1>In the U.S., Lax Formula Ad Regulations May Discourage Breastfeeding</h1>
<p>
By Laura Forman
</p>


<p>
In 2007, Kristina Graff, a new mom, entered her pediatrician’s office. She was worried. Despite being exclusively breastfed, her baby was not gaining weight as she’d hoped.
</p>

<p>
Graff expected support from her doctor, especially after being encouraged to breastfeed in the hospital after delivery. She was wrong.
</p>

<p>
“Maybe something’s wrong with your breast milk,” Graff recalled her doctor telling her.
</p>

<p>
Her pediatrician recommended supplementation with infant formula and even stressed a preferred brand.
</p>

<p>
“She said, ‘Enfamil is best.’ And I remember thinking, ‘Why?’” Graff recalled.
</p>

<p>
Graff’s experience isn’t usual. Questions regarding infant feeding top the laundry list of concerns parents bring to their pediatricians, according to a survey done by SERMO, an online network of physicians. And when that happens, doctors dole out free formula samples 59 percent of the time, the survey found.
</p>

<p>
Graff’s experience in part inspired her to research the impact on breastfeeding of infant formula distribution in the hospital setting. Now Director of Global Health Programs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public International Affairs at Princeton University, her research was instrumental in shaping regulatory policies that have limited the distribution of “discharge gift bags” containing free formula to moms leaving the hospital.
</p>

<p>
Despite greater limitations on free formula handouts to moms upon discharge, data from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention indicate that having hospitals accept free formula from manufacturers is another, perhaps even bigger part of the problem. In the 25 states that reported hospital acceptance rates of free formula as over 75 percent, exclusive breastfeeding rates at three months averaged just over 30 percent. In the 10 states where acceptance rates were below 60 percent, however, exclusive breastfeeding rates at three months averaged nearly 50 percent. 
</p>

<p>
Many countries have strict ad regulations in place to inhibit formula marketing practices, such as providing free or discounted inventory to hospitals. In the U.S., however, first amendment freedoms enable formula companies to market in and out of the hospital setting. 
</p>

<h3>United States Is An Outlier </h3>

<p>In 1981, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes, “the Code,” which limits advertising of infant formula. The Code received significant global support in a near unanimous vote in favor of the policy – except for a lone dissenting vote from the U.S.
</p>

<p>
Since then, individual countries have continued to tighten regulations. In 2007, the UK banned all formula ads directed to parents. In 2012, Sweden adopted new regulations against formula advertising, restricting manufacturers from using photos of babies on promotional materials. Earlier this year, Australian government officials announced a preliminary vote in favor of strict formula ad regulation, namely against marketing and free sampling to the medical community, pharmacies, and supermarkets. And just last month, the Chinese government announced it is considering even more stringent regulation on formula advertisements in an effort to increase breastfeeding rates. China already prohibits direct-to-consumer advertisements of formula intended for infants less than six months of age.
</p>

<p>
To combat marketing freedoms in the U.S., recent policy efforts, like Graff’s, have focused on limiting the hospital’s role in driving formula exposure in an effort to increase breastfeeding rates. 
</p>

<p>
In addition to banning free samples given to pregnant women, new mothers and families, the WHO’s Code regulating formula advertising states that health facilities and health professionals should not have a role in promoting breastmilk substitutes. Specifically, the Code prohibits product displays, posters or distribution of promotional materials in healthcare facilities. Further, it bans free or low-cost formula supplies to “any part of the healthcare system.”     
</p>

<p>As of 2011, 37 nations have adopted the Code in full. An additional 47 nations adopted many of the Codes’ provisions and nearly 30 more adopted some form of the Code, according to UNICEF. United States remains one of just six countries to have taken no action, along with Kazakhstan, Somalia, Chad, Iceland, and the Central African Republic.
</p>

<p>
In December of 1981, the New York Times quoted former Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, Elliott Abrams, defending opposition to strict formula ad bans in the U.S. A complete ban on advertising to the general public of infant formula threatened our “constitutional guarantees of free speech and freedom of information,” he said.

<p>In general, countries with greater ad regulations report higher rates of breastfeeding. In those countries where the Code is adopted full or to a large extent, breastfeeding rates averaged nearly 73 percent at 12 months, according to UNICEF. Those countries adopting just a few of the Code’s provisions, or where the Code’s enforcement is voluntary, have average breastfeeding rates of 63 percent at one year. Finally, those countries that have yet to take regulatory action, including the U.S., have average breastfeeding rates of just over 60 percent at one year. 
</p>

<p>Despite the positive influence of ad bans, individual country demographics continue to determine breastfeeding rates to some extent. In general, long-term breastfeeding rates are significantly higher in developing versus developed countries, WHO data show. While most babies continue to be breastfed past 12 months in developing countries, more than half of babies stop receiving any breastmilk by six months across developed countries.

<p>Wall Street analysts also suggest that some Code regulations may be less effective than others. Analysts predict a ban on direct-to-consumer ads in China, for example, will have little, if any, impact on formula sales. Top formula executives also dismiss the treat of consumer-directed ad bans.
</p>

<p>In an April conference call to investors, Mead Johnson Chief Executive Officer, Kasper Jakobsen, said banning DTC ads in China would simply mean a shift toward advertisement through the medical community. 
</p>

<p>“I think we’re very familiar with operating in these kinds of frameworks,” he said. “It allows us to utilize our medical sales force quite well.”
</p>

<h3>The Impact of Formula in the Hospital </h3>

<p>
In 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) raised its recommendation for exclusive breastfeeding to six months. Today, the AAP recommends breastfeeding in conjunction with solid food through 12 months, while the WHO recommends breastfeeding for two years. Policy makers hoped efforts to ban discharge bags containing formula would help support women in meeting these recommendations.    
</p>

<p>
In 2008, approximately 70 percent of hospitals provided discharge bags to patients. Today, this number is just above 30 percent, according to the CDC. Four states now ban discharge bags in all hospitals.     
</p>

<p>
In the midst of new hospital regulations, some measures of national breastfeeding have increased. Rates of any breastfeeding in the U.S. have risen from about 74 percent in 2011 to 79 percent in 2014, according to the CDC’s annual “Breast Feeding Report Card.”     
</p>

<p>
But just banning discharge bags doesn’t always work, the data show. Maryland, for example, has one of the lowest levels of breastfeeding at three months at 29 percent. Yet here, only 18 percent of hospitals reported formula handouts to moms leaving the hospital, well under the national average. 
</p>

<p>Longer-term breastfeeding rates remain low. In the U.S., more than half of moms are no longer breastfeeding by six months. At one year, just over a quarter of moms report any amount of continued breastfeeding. CDC data suggest that the mere acceptance of free formula by hospitals may have a greater impact on prolonged breastfeeding rates than giving new moms formula for free.  
</p>

<p>Nationwide, 75 percent of hospitals report accepting free formula from manufacturers, according to CDC data. States that accept free formula at especially high levels also tend to report very low levels of breastfeeding. In Mississippi, for example, the CDC reports virtually all hospitals are accepting free formula. Here, just over half of moms report any breastfeeding and only 17 percent report exclusive breastfeeding at three months, less than half the national average. 
</p>

<p>CDC data reveal a trend across Southern states, where breastfeeding levels have historically remained below average. Across Mississippi, Arkansas, Kentucky, Georgia, Louisiana, and Tennessee, only about half of moms report undertaking any amount of breastfeeding, nearly 20 percentage points lower than the national average. Almost all hospitals report accepting free formula in these six states.
</p>

<p>When summarizing her research, Graff said support in the hospital heavily influenced breastfeeding rates, along with support at home and in the workplace.
</p>

<p>Part of the problem, she reasoned, may be financial. What she called, “a provider effect.” In other words, the prevalence of free formula in the hospital may itself encourage hospitals to provide the formula to babies while in the hospital.
</p>

<p>“I sympathize with hospitals,” she said. “They have a business to run…It may be the case that when you have formula there and it costs the hospital nothing…it’s appealing.” 
</p>

<p>In New York, where acceptance rates of free formula are above average, data support this relationship. Here, 35 percent of hospitals report actually using the formula in the hospital, the highest level nationwide, along with Nevada. 
</p>

<p>Graff also speculated that high levels of formula usage in hospitals could have to do with simple psychology. “What we know from social psychology research is that repeated exposure to a brand makes it seem more trustworthy in the absence of other information,” she said.
</p>

<p>Susan Crowe, Clinical Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Stanford School of Medicine in Palo Alto, Calif., said the correlation between low breastfeeding rates and those hospitals that accept and use free formula may have to do with milk supply, which is generally established in the immediate days following delivery while a mom is still in the hospital. 
</p>

<p>“This could be related to the fact that early supplementation is a roadblock for establishing milk supply,” Crowe said. “While sometimes a baby has medical indications for supplementation, formula usage in the hospital during a baby’s first days of life could have a negative impact on breastfeeding.” 
</p>

<p>Crowe said once formula companies can get a hospital to accept any kind of handout – free formula inventory, for example – they often have free rein to send more goods, including marketing materials to strengthen their influence upon patients and providers. 
</p>

<p>“Soon a manufacturer has this major campaign here where they’re telling moms not to worry about their supply because there’s formula for them right here,” she said. “And it’s free.”
</p>

<p>Where individual hospitals have instituted policies against formula advertising, breastfeeding rates tend to be higher. Private hospital Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif., for example, does not allow any advertising of formula products, nor are formula reps permitted in its Women and Infants Units, according to Carolyn Kemp, communications and public relations regional manager. Alta Bates reported an exclusive breastfeeding rate of 89 percent in the hospital in 2013, according to the California WIC Association.
Alta Bates also has a policy against providing formula discharge bags to patients leaving the hospital. Kemp said the hospital does provide formula to select patients in the hospital, however, specifically in its newborn intensive care unit and to moms who are unable to breastfeed. 
</p>

<p>“We feel strongly those sorts of activities send the wrong message to our new mothers,” Kemp said of formula marketing in the hospital setting. She could not comment on whether the hospital received free formula samples from manufacturers.
</p>

<p>While Stanford’s Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital does provide patients with discharge bags, they do not include infant formula, according to Crowe. According to Robert Dicks, Senior Director of Media Relations at Lucile Packard, the hospital only provides free formula to moms “if the family has chosen to bottle feed.”  
</p>

<p>Lucile Packard does accept free formula, however, Dicks said. Stanford’s rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the hospital was 74 percent in 2013, though its rate of any breastfeeding was over 97 percent, according to the California WIC Association.

<p>In her book, Holding Corporations Accountable, Judith Richter cites intense competition to “donate” products to hospitals and other institutions as strong evidence of the value of medical endorsements. 
</p>

<p>During the 1970s, one company paid a million dollars to New York City to provide formula to all city hospitals, she wrote. Later in 1989, Abbott Laboratories and Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, the two largest formula manufacturers by market share in the U.S., engaged in a bidding war to provide free formula to Canada’s largest maternity ward.
</p>

<p>“Formula companies donate and give free formula to hospitals for a reason,” Crowe agreed. “It’s not out of altruism that they’re giving it.”
</p>

<p>Because formula supplementation is sometimes desired or medically necessary, formula manufacturers say they push for products and information in the hospital and doctor’s office setting for educational purposes. 
</p>

<p>“It’s important parents have not only the information they need to help ensure their baby’s optimal nutrition and overall well-being, but also feel supported by their hospitals and healthcare providers,” said Robin Applebaum, Communications Director for the Infant Nutrition Council of America. Mead Johnson representatives asked for Applebaum to comment on their behalf. 
</p>

<p>Lindsy Delco, Director of Public Affairs at Abbott, said Abbott formula samples and informational material are provided to hospitals both to educate moms and ensure they understand the benefits of the company’s Similac brand. 
</p>

<p>“The samples and educational materials we offer in the U.S. are one way we help moms when they have made the decision to introduce formula,” she said. 
</p>

<p>Delco said marketing of Abbott’s Similac formula brand is intended solely “for moms who cannot or choose not to use breast milk.” 
</p>

<p>“We market our Similac infant formulas to compete against other brands of infant formula, not to compete against breastfeeding,” she said in an email.     
</p>

<h3>Doctors as Salesmen</h3>

<p>
Richter profiles an excerpt from an Abbott/Ross training manual in her book. One section, entitled, “How to make a physician a low pressure sales person for our products,” suggests that once a mother chooses a brand of formula for her baby, she almost never switches brands. For formula companies, this can translate into easy customer retention once they can get their foot in the door.
</p>

<p>“When one considers that for every one hundred infants discharged from hospital on a particular brand, approximately 93 percent remain on that brand, the importance of hospital selling becomes obvious,” the manual instructs salesmen.
</p>

<p>Mead Johnson employed 1,350 individuals worldwide as part of its healthcare professional sales force in 2011, according to a JP Morgan report. “Healthcare professional recommendations are a critical marketing level,” wrote Terry Bivens, former JP Morgan senior analyst.
</p>

<p>Graff found the impact of a physician’s recommendation of formula to have a greater impact on a woman’s decision to use formula versus seeing an advertisement on her own. 
</p>

<p>Although she considers herself especially informed as a researcher, as a mother, she said she felt just as vulnerable as any new mom. 
</p>

<p>“When I look at these situations, I pull away everything that gives me an advantage,” Graff said. “And I think if I tore away all that and were in the same conversation, I would not even think to counter what pediatricians said. I would just do it.”
</p>

<p>Government Influential, Too
In the U.S., the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, led by the Department of Agriculture (USDA), gives nutritional support for infants of low-income families, including free formula. A $6 billion program, WIC is the largest purchaser of infant formula in the U.S., with roughly half of the country’s infants participating and receiving free vouchers for formula.
</p>

<p>The program is managed at the state level. A contract means the state must exclusively market the winner’s proprietary formula brand to suppliers, namely major pharmacies and retailers.
</p>

<p>U.S. market share for formula companies is contingent upon contracts won and lost. In fact, the WIC program accounts for more than half of Mead Johnson’s retail sales in the U.S., according to Ken Goldman, senior analyst at JP Morgan.
</p>

<p>Underscoring the value of state contracts, manufacturers provide formula virtually for free to retailers. Bigger states demand bigger discounts. California retailers, for example, which have the highest percentage of participants nationwide, enjoy discounts over 95 percent of wholesale price, according to analyst reports. 
</p>

<p>Despite the deep discounts formula manufacturers must endure to score state contracts, contract wins often more than compensate for lost upfront revenue. A 2011 Economic Research Service Report reported that companies gain nearly 7.5 percent market share in a given state within a number of months after winning a contract. The study also cites additional reasons why manufactures agree to participate, including additional shelf life with better product placement in retail stores. 
</p>

<p>The Economic Research Service Report also suggests the WIC program may encourage support for particular formula brands by the medical community. Hospitals and physicians, “may decide to recommend the WIC brand to all patients to avoid having to differentiate between those enrolled and not enrolled,” according to the study.
</p>

<h3>Formula Ad Budgets Continue to Rise</h3>

<p>Despite increases in global advertising regulation, leading formula manufacturers continue to increase advertising budgets. In 2014, the Wall Street Journal reported that marketing spend by formula manufacturers rose 70 percent from 2010. In 2015, Wall Street analysts expect this trend to continue, predicting record spending in the second quarter on ads by Mead Johnson, among others. 
</p>

<p>Especially in the U.S., where regulations remain low, manufacturers continue to find success in targeting new moms beginning in the hospital setting. A graphic included in a 2011 corporate presentation by Mead Johnson describes the company’s “demand generation model.” Beginning with pregnancy, they begin targeting “the hospital experience,” moving to ads for moms “coming home” and beyond. 
</p>

<p>As Jakobsen assured investors, “We have…metrics that show that when we [advertise], we get a trial. And when we get a trial, we get a repeat [purchase].”
</p>

<p>Mead Johnson did not return calls or emails regarding their formula advertising practices.
</p>

<p>According Richter, the regulation of the U.S. formula industry remains a “critical – and unfinished – task of global democratic governance.”
</p>

<p>Crowe agrees. “What I find most disturbing is that basically we’ve had a complete divorce from the pharma industry because of the known influence they can have,” she said. “Yet somehow formula was not considered in that. And I find it of questionable judgment that we’ve allowed that to continue.”
</p>
